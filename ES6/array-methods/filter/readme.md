# JavaScript `filter()` Practice 🍗🔥

This repository contains examples of using the **`filter()`** method in JavaScript.
Think of `filter()` like a **masala grill** — it selects only the items that pass your criteria (taste test) and leaves the rest.

---

## 🔹 What is `filter()`?
- `filter()` is an **array method** that creates a **new array** containing elements that pass a test implemented by a callback function.
- **Original array remains unchanged.**

---

## ✅ Syntax
```js
array.filter(function(element, index, array) {
  // return true to keep element, false to remove
});
